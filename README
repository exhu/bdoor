Backdoor server and clients.

Use to monitor/debug/develop running applications, e.g. to get remote log/debugging console etc.

Your app uses backdoor client (a running thread inside your application) to connect to the server, 
then you use the server to control your app,
e.g. inject commands, monitor components, read logs...

Will use generic protocol, YAML and/or JSON based etc.

Primary target is to use to modify and monitor mobile application state.
